## Memes

Slaps top of bagging machine\
This bad boy can fit so many unexpected items in bagging area

## Drinking games with Google Home or any virtual assistant.

Guess that genre of music: 

One person says a phrase\
If no song exists for said phrase take a drink.\
If the song does exist everyone has to guess a genre in the first 10 seconds\
Ask Google what genre the current song is.\
Take a drink if you didn't guess the genre correctly.\
Genre is negotiable among the party.
