### Be Square (Unity Game)
`Be Square` a game where a block turns on it's side to move.
- Two Modes: Progressive and Puzzle
- [ ] Progressive:
- Swipe up, down, left, right while the screen moves behind you. Swipe too slow and your block will get eaten
- This is an endless game where the player has a chance to get as many points as possible

- [ ] Puzzle:
- Player will be given an overview of the entire playing field
- The player will need to swipe on the screen the predicted path the block will take
- Once the player is satisfied with the swipe path, they can then press the [Play] button
- The block will begin to turn and move through the puzzle
- present the player the opportunity to 'rescue' their block
- Award the player if they get to the goal area
- Add stars to the system, secret paths the player can make in a game.

## Memes

Slaps top of bagging machine\
This bad boy can fit so many unexpected items in bagging area

## Drinking games with Google Home or any virtual assistant.

Guess that genre of music: 

One person says a phrase\
If no song exists for said phrase take a drink.\
If the song does exist everyone has to guess a genre in the first 10 seconds\
Ask Google what genre the current song is.\
Take a drink if you didn't guess the genre correctly.\
Genre is negotiable among the party.
